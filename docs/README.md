## env_make.md
The file env_make is used to customize the *make* process for *AVR_C* development. It is **required** in order for make to properly identify the parameters needed for compiling/linking/uploading executable code to an AVR microcontroller. **This file is not tracked by *git* and needs to be installed manually.** 

## vs_code.md
This page contains the files needed to be more efficient with *VS Code*. Install them inot the *.vscode* folder of *AVR_C*. They are not tracked by *git*.

## git.md
Notes on using *git*. I am neither an expert on *git* nor proficient in *git*. This page is primarily for myself, however, it has helped a few people.

## RPI_build.md
If you want to use a Raspberry Pi (3/4/5) as a C development platform, this page is for you! Highly detailed, it will show every step required to build the latest software for developing C on an AVR microcontroller. Have fun! 

## xArm.md
In my teaching, I have begin to write code for the xArm 6DOF robotic arm. Its a nice, however, expensive robotic arm. This page will describe how to use *AVR_C* (*C99 C*) as compared to *Arduino*.

## multitasking_kernel.md
A introductory article on multi-tasking, with a great example of how to multitasking in C using a few lines of code. Article is no longer on the embedded.com site, so I've reproduced it here.
